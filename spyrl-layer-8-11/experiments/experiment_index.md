# ðŸ”¬ Spyrl Layer 11 â€“ Falsifiable Experiment Index

This document lists all proposed experiments that test the predictions of Layer 11 (Recursive Symbolic Phase Control, RSPC) across various domains.

| Experiment Name | Domain | Prediction | Test Type | Falsifiable If |
|----------------|--------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| EEG Phase-Injection Trials | Neuroscience | Symbolic inputs aligned to neural phase (Î¦) elicit stronger or more coherent EEG responses than randomly timed inputs. | Closed-loop EEG, ERP & phase coherence analysis | No measurable Î”S between phase-aligned vs. random symbolic input |
| Recursive Code Timing Experiments | Computation | Symbolic code injected at precise recursion phase triggers different or amplified system states than the same input at other times. | Instrumented recursive function, input injection at tracked RD and Î¦ | Output does not vary with timing despite matching logic and content |
| Musical Motif Phase Alignment Tests | Music Cognition | Motifs inserted at rhythmic or structural Î¦ points are perceived differently (emotionally or cognitively) than off-phase versions. | Perception ratings, EEG/fMRI during motif injection at on-beat vs. off-beat | No subjective or neural difference between timing variants |
| Meme Emergence Timing Analysis | Social Dynamics | Viral content appears more frequently when posted during collective Î¦ windows (shared cycles in attention/sentiment). | Time-series of viral vs. non-viral content vs. phase of engagement signals | No statistically significant timing pattern differences |
| Symbolic Placebo Timing Trials | Psychophysiology / Medicine | Placebo effects are stronger when ritual/symbolic suggestion is given during a physiological/neurological receptive phase. | Timed placebo administration based on bio/EEG phase | No phase-dependent modulation of placebo strength |
| Symbolic Motif Recursion Matching | AI / NLP | Language model outputs change when symbolic prompts match internal recursion depth or rhythm. | Timed prompt injection at inferred internal loop Î¦/RD | No systematic shift in model output pattern |
