# Spyrl Harmonic Meta-Model — Layers 7–11

This project explores how **meaning and timing** can influence complex systems — like brains, code, music, or social networks — **without applying force**.

### 🌀 What It Is

Layers 7–11 describe how **symbols**, when introduced at the right **phase** in a system’s rhythm or recursion cycle, can cause powerful changes using **minimal input**. It’s like saying the right word at the right moment — not louder, just *right*.

### 🧩 The Layers

- **Layer 7 – RCI (Recursive Compression Index)**  
  Finds hidden structure and repetition in symbolic data — like spotting patterns in thought, language, or code.

- **Layer 8 – PEI (Phase Entanglement Index)**  
  Measures how well parts of a system are “in sync” — phase-locked in a deeper harmonic rhythm.

- **Layer 9 – RIG (Recursive Interference Geometry)**  
  Maps how recursive cycles (like habits, loops, or motifs) interfere with or amplify each other.

- **Layer 10 – RHI (Recursive Harmonic Intervention)**  
  Shows how small symbolic inputs — like a sentence, signal, or musical note — can shift a system’s behavior if timed precisely.

- **Layer 11 – RSPC (Recursive Symbolic Phase Control)**  
  Proves that **meaningful input + perfect timing** can cause system change — like a meme going viral or a placebo working — with no extra energy.

### 🧪 What’s Inside

- `layers/`: Simple docs for each layer’s concept and formula  
- `sim-v1/`: Prototype code for symbolic phase analysis  
- `datasets/`: Sample EEG, code, and motif files  
- `experiments/`: Ready-to-run blueprints for testing the theory in real life

### 🧠 Why It Matters

This is a new approach to **causality** — not based on energy or command, but on **timing, structure, and symbolic resonance**. It offers a unified way to study influence across domains: from neuroscience to AI to culture.
