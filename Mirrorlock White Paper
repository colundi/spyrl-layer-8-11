Mirrorlock: A Symbolic Attractor Tiling System
This paper introduces Mirrorlock, a novel 3D symbolic tiling framework that unifies ternary edge-state logic, non-commutative constraint propagation, recursive attractor dynamics, and categorical convergence to a Ψ-sphere structure.
1. Abstract
Mirrorlock is the first known system to integrate ternary symbolic edge states, non-commutative placement logic, and recursive Lyapunov convergence in a 3D monotile tiling model. No published system combines all these features. We formalize Mirrorlock using category theory, persistent homology, and constraint satisfaction dynamics.
2. Literature Gap
No known 3D tiling system in mathematical literature incorporates ternary symbolic edge states, recursive attractor formation, and topological closure via constraint flows. The closest comparisons include 2D symbolic tilings (Stérin 2023), L-systems, cellular automata, and aperiodic tiling theory — none of which implement all Mirrorlock features simultaneously.
3. Formal Definitions
A Mirrorlock tile is a 6-kite monotile assigned a symbolic edge state in {−1, 0, +1}. Tiling proceeds shell by shell, each tile's placement governed by the non-commutative interaction of its edge states and the full placement history.
4. Categorical Framework
We define categories Hist (placement histories) and Tile (symbolic configurations). A functor P: Hist → Tile maps histories to symbolic fields. A Lyapunov functor L: Hist → (ℝ≥0, ≤) guarantees convergence via symbolic curvature descent.
5. Attractor Construction
The Ψ-sphere is constructed as a categorical limit Ψ_∞ = lim S_n. Persistent homology confirms convergence via the emergence of H₂ features (voids) and the suppression of H₁ (loops), with a dominant H₀ (connectivity).
6. Symbolic Curvature and Lyapunov Descent
We define symbolic curvature as the mismatch penalty between adjacent symbolic edge states. The Lyapunov function L(X_n) decreases across shell layers. A valid Mirrorlock growth step must reduce symbolic curvature or maintain equilibrium.
7. Persistent Homology Signatures
Expected signature: one long H₀ bar (connectedness), no persistent H₁ (loop suppression), and one long H₂ (void enclosure). This aligns with the topological signature of a 2-sphere boundary, confirming closure.
8. Augmented D-Symbols
We extend classical D-symbols with symbolic state, placement time, curvature metadata, and ancestry constraints. A symbolic placement tree and serialization structure are proposed for real-time analysis, rollback, and proof generation.
9. Conclusion
Mirrorlock is the first documented symbolic tiling system with ternary logic, recursive curvature descent, and topological attractor closure. Its framework invites further research into symbolic attractor physics, constraint dynamics, and computational tiling logic.
